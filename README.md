## info
This project shows how to use basics of JavaScript to create a simple point-and-click game by interacting with document object model. To make the game efficient and simple I divided the code logic into two main parts: the player choice and the computer choice. The core of the logic is based on if statements, loops and setTimeout callback. The data is kept in local storage.

## rules
Rules:
- make a choice by clicking on one of the figures
- click PLAY to see the computer choice
- you can see the statistics at the bottom of the screen

## technology
HTTML5, SASS + BEM, JavaScript, Gulp
