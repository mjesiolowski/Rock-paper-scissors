# rockPaperScissors

As I have been discovering some JavaScript tips lately, I decided to make this 'rock, paper, scissors' mini-game from scratch.

The project shows how to use basics of JavaScript by interacting with document object model to create a simple point-and-click game. To make the game efficient and simple I divided the code logic into two main parts: the player choice and the computer choice. The core of the logic is based on if statements, loops and setTimeout calleback.

Rules:
- make a choice by clicking on one of the figures
- click PLAY to see the computer choice
- you can see the statistics at the bottom of the screen


Technology:
HTTML5, CSS, vanilla JS, RWD
